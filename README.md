# 3D Game-Engine

In this project we were obliged to create 3D rendering engine, generally A three-dimensional (3D) engine, often called a game engine, is a system used for virtual computer simulations. Game engines are commonly used in video games. A 3D engine has several area of functionality, which work together to create an immersive virtual environment. The rendering component of a game engine calculates the visual appearance of a scene, while a physics component determines how different objects should interact.
