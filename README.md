# 3D Game-Engine

In this project we were obliged to create 3D rendering engine, generally A three-dimensional (3D) engine, often called a game engine, is a system used for virtual computer simulations. Game engines are commonly used in video games. A 3D engine has several area of functionality, which work together to create an immersive virtual environment. The rendering component of a game engine calculates the visual appearance of a scene, while a physics component determines how different objects should interact.

## Installation
Git should be installed on your device

* Git installed on the computer
* Any IDE that supports Java
* (Dependencies that are needed, will be installed automaticlly when you will build the project)

Install Game Engine with git:

* Click the "CODE" on the right top corner of the project and click HTTPS then go ahead and copy the link which would look like this: 
  https://github.com/Game-Engine-4/Game-Engine.git
* Next open terminal in the file you want to clone the project to and type this:

  Git clone [INSERT LINK HERE]
  
* And everything is done correctly
